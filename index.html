    <p>When Donald is asked about what body parts 1-year-old Ivanka shares with Donald and Marla:</p>
    <h3>"She's got Marla's legs. We don't know whether or not she's got (cupping his hands to his chest) this part yet, but time will tell."</h3>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>After asking a girl if she's going up the escalator (you hear her say "yeah"):</p>
    <h3>"I'm going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?"</h3>

    <p>After asking a couple of teenage girls that just performed in a choir:</p>
    <h3>"Wow! Just think, in a couple of years I'll be dating you."</h3>

    <br>
    <p>Trump objectified Ivanka at 1 (and has done so many other times throughout her life: Howard Stern called her a 'piece of ass' and Donald agreed with him).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Objectification can be considered a form of pedophilia when used against children.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Trump can't claim to want to date them later if he wasn't already attracted to them when he made the comments.</p>
    <p>Being a pedophile doesn't require you to have sex with children, only to be attracted to them.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>You said before that when it comes to family with different politcal opinions, you agree to not discuss politics</p>
    <p>Dad tried to show me the 'Things Kamala has Accomplished' book, and you blocked his attempt. Despite this, you send me a Newsom meme video,</p>
    <p>going against what you've told me before about discussing politics, and going against dad. Hence my outburst.<p>
